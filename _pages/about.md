## 🔬 Research Experience   

### **Optimizing Building Energy Efficiency with Phase Change Materials**  
For my undergraduate thesis, I worked on analyzing the impact of Phase Change Materials (PCMs) in buildings to improve energy efficiency. Using Design Builder and Energy Plus, I simulated how PCMs behave under different climate conditions in Bangladesh and evaluated how much energy they could help save. The goal was to understand how integrating these materials could reduce power consumption in buildings, making them more sustainable.  

### **Automated Solar Tracking for Smarter Energy Storage**  
In my third-year project, I developed an automated single-axis solar tracking system to improve solar panel efficiency. Using Arduino and C++, I built a system that adjusts solar panels to follow the sun for maximum power generation. The project also evaluated how this approach compares to traditional static solar panels in terms of efficiency and battery storage performance.

## 🏭 Industry Exposure  

In 2022, I completed a one-week attachment program at Khulna Power Company Ltd. (KPCL), where I had the opportunity to visit and study real-world energy facilities such as:  

- Petromax Refinery Limited  
- Bangabandhu Water Treatment Plant, Khulna WASA 
- HAMKO & Abdulla Battery Co. (ABCO)
